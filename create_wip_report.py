This is a quest story because it follows the journey of identifying the magnitude of global health disparities and seeks to uncover the underlying causes. The central visualization (bubble plot) shows how three critical factors (immunization, GDP, and life expectancy) interact, revealing patterns that aren't visible when examining each factor in isolation. Supporting visualizations further break down these relationships, showing how developed nations consistently outperform developing ones across key health indicators.
