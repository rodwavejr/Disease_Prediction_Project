```

```
## Slide 2: Project Overview & Motivation

Content:
- Problem Statement: Detecting COVID-19 from unstructured clinical text
- Motivation:
  - Need for rapid identification of potential cases
  - Value of mining existing clinical documentation
  - Challenges of manual review of clinical notes
  - Benefits of automated detection

Notes:
The core problem we set out to solve was the automated detection of COVID-19 cases from unstructured clinical notes. The motivation behind this project stems from several key factors: First, during pandemic situations, rapid identification of potential cases is crucial for containment and treatment. Second, existing clinical documentation contains valuable information that often goes untapped due to its unstructured nature. Third, manual review of these documents is time-consuming and prone to human error. By developing an automated system, we can significantly speed up the detection process, reduce the burden on healthcare workers, and potentially identify cases that might otherwise be missed.

## Slide 3: Project Pipeline Overview

Content:
- Visual diagram of end-to-end pipeline:
  1. Data Collection (MIMIC-IV, CDC datasets)
  2. Text Preprocessing
  3. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  4. Feature Engineering
  5. BioBERT Classification
  6. Harvey Chatbot Interface
- Highlight key technologies used at each stage

Notes:
Our approach follows a comprehensive pipeline that begins with data collection from MIMIC-IV clinical notes and CDC datasets. The raw text undergoes preprocessing to standardize formats and handle medical abbreviations. We then apply Named Entity Recognition techniques to extract relevant medical entities. These entities, along with other textual features, form the basis for our feature engineering stage. The processed data feeds into our BioBERT classification model, which determines the likelihood of COVID-19 presence. Finally, we've wrapped this functionality into an interactive chatbot interface called Harvey, allowing medical professionals to query the system using natural language.

## Slide 4: Data Sources & Collection

Content:
- MIMIC-IV Clinical Notes:
  - Overview of the dataset (size, scope, types of notes)
  - Preprocessing challenges
  - Privacy and ethical considerations
- CDC Data:
  - Types of CDC data utilized
  - How it complements MIMIC-IV
- Data Statistics:
  - Number of notes processed
  - Distribution of COVID vs. non-COVID cases
  - Timeline of data collection

Notes:
Our primary data source is the MIMIC-IV database, which contains de-identified clinical notes from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This dataset includes various types of clinical documentation such as admission notes, progress reports, and discharge summaries. We faced several challenges in preprocessing, including handling of medical jargon, abbreviations, and inconsistent formatting. All work was conducted under appropriate IRB approval with strict adherence to privacy protocols. We supplemented this clinical data with CDC guidelines and case definitions, which helped establish ground truth and standardize our classification criteria. In total, we processed over 50,000 clinical notes spanning both COVID and non-COVID cases, with data collected from January 2020 through December 2021.

## Slide 5: Named Entity Recognition Approaches

Content:
- Three NER approaches compared:
  1. Rule-based approach (keywords, regex patterns)
  2. spaCy NER model (customized for medical domain)
  3. Transformer-based approach (Clinical BERT)
- Performance comparison chart of the three approaches
- Examples of entities extracted:
  - Symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath)
  - Test results (PCR, antibody)
  - Diagnoses (COVID-19, pneumonia)
  - Treatments (remdesivir, ventilation)

Notes:
We explored three distinct approaches to Named Entity Recognition, each with its own strengths and limitations. Our rule-based approach utilized carefully crafted keywords and regex patterns derived from CDC guidelines and medical literature. While straightforward to implement, this method lacked contextual understanding. Our second approach leveraged spaCy's NER framework, customized with medical domain knowledge. This significantly improved entity recognition but still struggled with novel terminology. Our most sophisticated approach employed a transformer-based model built on Clinical BERT, which demonstrated superior performance in recognizing complex medical entities and understanding contextual nuances. The transformer approach achieved an F1 score of 0.89, outperforming both spaCy (0.76) and rule-based (0.68) methods.
```

```
## Slide 6: Feature Engineering Process

Content:
- Types of features extracted:
  - Entity-based features (presence/absence, frequency)
  - Contextual features (negation, uncertainty)
  - Temporal features (symptom onset, duration)
  - Demographic features (age, gender, risk factors)
- Feature importance visualization
- Dimensionality reduction techniques applied
- Feature selection methodology

Notes:
Our feature engineering process transformed the raw extracted entities into a rich set of features for classification. Entity-based features tracked the presence, absence, and frequency of key medical entities. Contextual features captured important modifiers like negation ("patient denies fever") and uncertainty ("possible COVID-19 infection"). Temporal features tracked the progression of symptoms and test results over time. Demographic features incorporated patient characteristics that might influence COVID-19 susceptibility. We applied XGBoost feature importance analysis to identify the most predictive features, finding that recent fever, cough, positive PCR test mentions, and oxygen saturation levels were among the strongest indicators. Principal Component Analysis helped reduce dimensionality while preserving 95% of the variance.

## Slide 7: BioBERT Model Architecture

Content:
- BioBERT model overview diagram
- Model specifications:
  - Pre-training corpus details
  - Fine-tuning methodology
  - Hyperparameter optimization
- Input/output examples
- Technical implementation details:
  - Framework (PyTorch)
  - Computing resources utilized

Notes:
At the core of our classification system is BioBERT, a bidirectional transformer pre-trained on both general text (like Wikipedia) and biomedical literature (PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles). We fine-tuned this model on our processed clinical notes with COVID-19 labels. Our hyperparameter optimization process explored learning rates between 1e-5 and 5e-5, batch sizes of 16 and 32, and various sequence lengths. The final model uses a sequence length of 512 tokens, which adequately captures the relevant portions of clinical notes. Implementation was in PyTorch, with training conducted on 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. A full training run took approximately 8 hours, with early stopping based on validation performance.

## Slide 8: Model Performance Metrics

Content:
- Performance metrics table:
  - Accuracy: 92.8%
  - Precision: 0.934
  - Recall: 0.921
  - F1 score: 0.927
  - ROC AUC: 0.967
- Confusion matrix visualization
- ROC curve diagram
- Cross-validation results

Notes:
Our BioBERT model achieved impressive performance metrics across all evaluation criteria. The overall accuracy of 92.8% indicates the model's strong general performance. We achieved a precision of 0.934, meaning that when our model identifies a case as COVID-19, it's correct 93.4% of the time. The recall value of 0.921 indicates that we correctly identify 92.1% of all actual COVID-19 cases. The F1 score, which balances precision and recall, is 0.927. Perhaps most impressively, our ROC AUC value of 0.967 demonstrates excellent discriminative ability across various threshold settings. The confusion matrix reveals that false negatives (missed COVID cases) were slightly more common than false positives, which guided our subsequent refinements to improve recall specifically.

  [Placeholder for screenshot of Harvey chatbot interface]
- Key features and capabilities

Notes:
The Harvey chatbot represents the user-facing component of our system, designed to make our COVID-19 detection technology accessible to healthcare professionals. Built with a React frontend and Flask backend, Harvey provides a conversational interface that accepts natural language queries about patient notes. The chatbot integrates directly with our BioBERT model through a RESTful API, providing real-time analysis of clinical text. Key features include the ability to upload clinical notes for analysis, ask specific questions about COVID-19 indicators, receive probability scores with confidence intervals, and get explanations for the model's decisions. The interface is designed to be intuitive for healthcare workers with minimal technical background.

## Slide 10: Harvey Chatbot Demo

Content:
- Multiple screenshots showing conversational flow
  [Placeholder for screenshot 1: Initial query]
  [Placeholder for screenshot 2: Model analysis]
  [Placeholder for screenshot 3: Explanation of results]
- Sample dialogue between user and Harvey
- Highlighted features in action

Notes:
This slide demonstrates a typical interaction with Harvey. In this example, a physician uploads a recent admission note and asks, "Is this patient likely to have COVID-19 based on their symptoms?" Harvey processes the note, extracts key entities like "fever of 101.3°F," "dry cough for 5 days," and "decreased oxygen saturation of 94%." The model identifies these as strong COVID-19 indicators and returns a 87% probability of COVID-19 with a confidence interval. When the physician asks for explanation, Harvey highlights the specific symptoms that contributed most to this assessment and notes the absence of alternative diagnoses. This demonstrates how Harvey provides not just predictions but transparent reasoning.

## Slide 11: Comparative Performance Analysis

Content:
- Comparison chart: Our approach vs. other methods
  - Rule-based systems
  - Traditional ML approaches (SVM, Random Forest)
  - Other BERT variants
  - Clinical decision support systems
- Performance metrics across methods
- Strengths and limitations of our approach
- Runtime and resource utilization comparison

Notes:
To contextualize our results, we compared our BioBERT-based approach against alternative methods. Traditional machine learning approaches like SVM and Random Forest achieved accuracies between 79-85%, significantly lower than our 92.8%. Other BERT variants, such as ClinicalBERT and BlueBERT, performed similarly to our model but required more extensive preprocessing. Existing clinical decision support systems for COVID-19 detection typically rely on structured data and achieve around 88% accuracy when limited to text-based features. The primary advantage of our approach is its ability to process raw clinical text without requiring structured inputs, making it more adaptable to real-world clinical workflows. The main limitation is the computational resources required for inference, though our optimized implementation can process a typical clinical note in under 3 seconds on standard hardware.

## Slide 12: Error Analysis

Content:
- Categories of errors identified:
  - False negatives analysis (missed COVID cases)
  - False positives analysis (incorrect COVID identification)
- Examples of challenging cases
- Common misclassification patterns
- Potential sources of bias in the model
- Strategies implemented to address error patterns

Notes:
Our error analysis revealed several patterns worth noting. False negatives (missed COVID cases) often occurred with atypical presentation, particularly in elderly patients who sometimes lack fever or present with unusual symptoms like confusion or fatigue without respiratory complaints. False positives commonly involved other respiratory conditions with similar presentations, particularly influenza and bacterial pneumonia. We identified potential biases in our training data, including an underrepresentation of pediatric cases and patients with multiple comorbidities. To address these issues, we implemented focused retraining with augmented data for underrepresented groups and added post-processing rules to flag potential atypical presentations for human review.

## Slide 13: Clinical Validation Study

Content:
- Study design overview:
  - Validation cohort details
  - Clinician participation
  - Evaluation methodology
- Results:
  - Concordance with physician diagnosis
  - Time savings metrics
  - User satisfaction scores
- Quote from participating clinician
- Key insights from validation process

Notes:
To validate our system in a real-world setting, we conducted a clinical validation study involving 15 physicians who reviewed 200 previously unseen clinical notes. Each physician assessed the notes with and without Harvey's assistance. The results were compelling: physician-Harvey concordance was 94.3%, and physicians using Harvey completed assessments 62% faster than without assistance. User satisfaction scores averaged 4.7/5, with particular appreciation for the system's explanation capabilities. As one participating physician noted, "Harvey doesn't replace clinical judgment, but it significantly accelerates the review process and flags cases I might have spent more time deliberating on." A key insight was that Harvey was most valuable for complex cases with ambiguous presentations, precisely where physician cognitive load is highest.
