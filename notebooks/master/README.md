# Master Notebooks

This directory contains comprehensive notebooks that integrate all aspects of the COVID-19 Detection Project pipeline. These notebooks demonstrate the end-to-end flow from raw data to validated prediction models.

## Text_Mining_NER_to_BioBERT_Pipeline.ipynb

This notebook implements the complete text mining and prediction pipeline for COVID-19 detection. It covers:

1. **Data Exploration**: Examining clinical notes and structured data
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracting medical entities from text
3. **Feature Engineering**: Converting entities to structured features
4. **Data Integration**: Combining NER features with structured data
5. **BioBERT Model Training**: Training transformer models for COVID prediction
6. **Model Evaluation**: Validating performance metrics

### Pipeline Overview

The notebook follows our project's two-stage approach:

```
Clinical Notes → NER → Feature Extraction → Integration with Structured Data → BioBERT Prediction
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Torch 1.7+
- Transformers 4.0+
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn

### Running the Notebook

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source ../covid_venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Text_Mining_NER_to_BioBERT_Pipeline.ipynb
   ```

3. Run all cells to see the complete pipeline in action

### Model Performance

The notebook includes comprehensive model evaluation metrics:
- ROC curves comparing BioBERT vs. traditional ML approaches
- Confusion matrices for error analysis
- Precision-recall curves
- Feature importance analysis

### Practical Application

The notebook concludes with a practical application demo:
- Takes a new clinical note as input
- Extracts relevant entities using NER
- Formats entities for the BioBERT model
- Produces COVID-19 risk assessment with probability score

## Future Directions

Additional master notebooks are planned to explore:
- Multi-modal integration (text + imaging)
- Temporal analysis of symptom progression
- Geographic and demographic risk analysis
